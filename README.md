# The Noona Way

More than our products, more than  our brand, Noona is at its core a group of people.

A group of diverse, unique individuals working together on a shared mission:

&#x20;ðŸ‘‰ _Help locals everywhere build meaningful business relationships_

This last word, _relationships_, is especially important to us.

Human beings are social animals, which means that we feel best, and we do our best work, in tribes and teams.

But as everyone knows it's not a given for a group of diverse, unique individuals to be able to work together effortlessly in such a way that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.

Historically, when such groups emerge, it's because of shared values and principles that influence both behaviour and emotions. The difference between a random group of people and a tribe, a great team, or even a family, is a shared purpose and a feeling that everyone has each other's back.

If you are reading this, you most likely work at Noona, which means you are both talented and unique. The same goes for all the people you work with.

But despite our uniqueness and all of our differences we are able to work as one, because we all share the same values and try our best to act in accordance with the **Noona Way:**

#### Growth

* I will not let myself fall behind when it comes to the Noona Way.
* I believe everyone, including myself, is capable of growth.
* I optimise for the [Slope](https://www.notion.so/Slope-32f5fadce4ac4f53bdcaea4607133730), not the position.
* I welcome mistakes as an opportunity to learn and develop principles.
* I realize that all change starts with me.

#### Impact

* I seek actions with high [Leverage](https://www.notion.so/Leverage-8b4fac440d1d4d85b63e95b7a28c273c) that are likely to have a big, positive [Impact](https://www.notion.so/Impact-ab81e37088044ce98ce148d67128db6c).
* I focus my energy on what really matters in any given situation.
* I work hard on what is essential and bring it to the finish line.

#### Quality

* I don't settle for "good enough", but I know perfection is a fool's errand.
* I am a student of quality and look for it in the work of others.
* I take pride in all aspects of my work.
* I believe quality is the result of multiple iterations.
* I do less, but better.

#### Honesty

* I am compassionately honest.
* I do not avoid difficult conversations, I welcome them.
* I don't lie to myself, especially with regards to my own strengths and weaknesses.
* I expect honesty from the people I work with and I always take them seriously.

#### Egolessness

* I focus on outcomes and always do what is best for the whole.
* I am open minded and never stuck in my ways.
* I give and receive feedback like the gift it truly is.
* I celebrate the success of others.

#### Caring

* I try to listen more than I talk.
* I give others my full, undivided attention.
* I am not afraid to be vulnerable.
* I am always ready to offer a helping hand.

#### Judgement

* I seek [First-Principles](https://www.notion.so/First-Principles-c09923e9732047fcb0b43886d8ebd594), try my best to identify root causes, and get beyond treating symptoms.
* I always think about the long term but focus on the short term.
* I seek advice and do my research before making impactful decisions.
* I always know what I am trying to do, and just as important, what I am not.
* I'm data informed, but experiments driven

#### Accountability

* I do what I say I'm going to do.
* I welcome more responsibility, but I know when to delegate.
* I am accountable for the consequences of my actions, good or bad.
* I lead by example, and I never ask anyone to do something I wouldnâ€™t do myself.

#### Purpose

* I find meaning in helping others.
* I believe a good life is built with meaningful work and meaningful relationships.
* I consider our customers an extension of our team, and I would do anything for my team.
* I am here to do the best work of my life, because I know anything else is a waste of both talent and time.

Like everything we create, the Noona Way is an iterative process and not set in stone.

If a part of it does not resonate with you, or if there is something that you feel like is missing, you are encouraged to bring it up for discussion. We evolve and become better through honest, growth-orientated conversations about important topics.

Still, changing the Noona Way is a little bit like changing a country's constitution, and should not be done lightly. Unintended consequences are real, and according to the principle of [Wu Wei](https://www.notion.so/Wu-Wei-0adf722b4dca4a3a88824c86d02abda6) it's often better to do nothing and allow things to flow down their natural path.

At the end of the day, we believe that you will do your best work if you invest in _Growing_ your Self and focus on doing _Impactful_ things of high _Quality._ This is only possible with an attitude of _Egolessness_, help from your _Honest, Caring_ team \*\*members \*\*and good _Judgement._ By showing _Accountability_ you learn from your failures and reap the benefits of your successes, both of which fuels even more individual and organizational _Growth_.

We think this is a blueprint for both meaningful work and meaningful relationships, which, given enough time, will result in a fulfilling life brimming with _Purpose_.
